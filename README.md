# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python
This all-new [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118290275) is designed to provide an introduction to data structures and algorithms, including their design, analysis, and implementation. The authors take advantage of the beauty and simplicity of Python to present executable source code that is clear and concise. 

I add my 'work out' code based on this book to this repo.
